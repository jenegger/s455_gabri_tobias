(macro Philipp used to create mapping file: /u/land/klenze/r3bmap/run/califa/mapping/ucesb_mapping_gen_CALIFA_TOT.py)


The calibration file dummy_sofia.par is the same as /u/land/r3broot/202106_testing/R3BRoot_20210726/sofia/macros/s455Up2p/parameters/CalibParam.par


For further data checking we look at following lmd files:
-> main0208_0008.lmd (as it is one of the beginnings)
-> main0220_0004.lmd (this was after the lxana01 crash, do we see some shifts in WRTS?? this has to be investigated....)
